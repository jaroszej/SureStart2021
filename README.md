### DAY 1

_What do I hope to gain from the SureStart program?_
  I am eager to gain a lot from SureStart. I am excited to have hands-on experience with ML and AI and I am excited for the professional skills this program will help me develop. I am excited to experience working in a team of talented people and I hope to learn from them as much as I can from the SureStart program itself. I am nervous about presenting a project for the make-a-thon in the final 2 weeks, yet I am still excited to gain experience speaking for a project I will be proud to have developed.
