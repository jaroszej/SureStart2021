_What do I hope to gain from the SureStart program?_

  I am eager to gain a lot from SureStart. I am excited to have hands-on experience with ML and AI and I am excited for the professional skills this program will help me develop. I am excited to experience working in a team of talented people and I hope to learn from them as much as I can from the SureStart program itself. I am nervous about presenting a project for the make-a-thon in the final 2 weeks, yet I am still excited to gain experience speaking for a project I will be proud to have developed.

_What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?_

With supervised learning, the program is given a data set of examples for it to follow and generalize on new experiences in the future. Typically, the ultimate goal is to develop a finely tuned predictor function.
Unsupervised learning allows the program to develop patterns and relationships when given a huge data set and one or a multitude of goals.

_Why is the statement 'Scikit-learn has the power to visualize data without another data analysis library' false?_

Scikit-learn is a library comprised of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms that is built on top of the SciPy stack, which includes NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, IPython, Sympy, and Pandas. These other libraries must be installed before scikit-learn can be used.
Scikit-learn is focused on modeling data. For loading, manipulating, and summarizing data, refer to NumPy and Pandas.
